Exoplanet Detection & Characterization
Challenge (Kepler DR25)
Background
The Kepler Space Telescope identified thousands of potential exoplanets by monitoring stellar
brightness and detecting periodic transit signals. However, not all detected signals correspond
to real planets — many arise from astrophysical false positives, instrumental effects, or stellar
variability.
In this challenge, you are provided with a dataset derived from the final Kepler Data Release
(DR25), consisting of transit observables for Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) merged with
host-star parameters. The dataset reflects the uncertainty, incompleteness, and biases
inherent in real astronomical observations.

Project Goal
You will work on two supervised learning tasks using the same dataset and further integrate
the model into a modularized web application

Objectives
●​ Accepts user inputs via a frontend interface​
●​ Ensures robust input validation​
●​ Communicates securely with a backend service​
●​ Applies a consistent preprocessing pipeline​
●​ Performs real-time predictions using pre-trained models​
●​ Presents results with interpretable outputs and visual insights​
●​ Optionally maintains a history of user inputs and predictions

Dataset Description
The dataset contains one row per Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) and includes:

Transit-related features
●​ Orbital period​
●​ Transit depth and duration​
●​ Impact parameter​
●​ Signal-to-noise metrics​
●​ Number of observed transits​

Host-star properties
●​ Effective temperature​
●​ Surface gravity​
●​ Metallicity​
●​ Stellar mass, radius, and density​
●​ Associated measurement uncertainties​

All features are provided in raw form, without normalization, imputation, or feature synthesis.

Required System Architecture
1. Frontend Layer (User Interface)
●​ Provide a clean and intuitive interface for users to enter input features required by the
model​

●​ Display brief descriptions or tooltips explaining each input feature and relevant ML terms​
●​ Allow users to submit input data for prediction​
●​ Display prediction results and visualizations clearly​

2. Frontend Validation
●​ Perform client-side validation to ensure:​
○​ Required fields are not empty​
○​ Input values are within acceptable ranges​
○​ Data types (numeric, categorical, etc.) are correct​
●​ Provide immediate feedback to users for invalid inputs before making API calls​

3. API Communication with Backend
●​ Send validated input data from the frontend to the backend via RESTful API calls​
●​ Ensure secure and structured data transfer (e.g., JSON format)​
●​ Handle API responses, errors, and timeouts gracefully​

4. Build ML Pipeline
●​ Reproducible preprocessing pipeline​
●​ Feature selection informed by EDA​
●​ Support for both classification and regression inference​

5. Model Inference
●​ Load a pre-trained machine learning model in the backend​
●​ Perform real-time inference on preprocessed input data​
●​ Support extensibility for future model updates​

6. Prediction Output and Visualization
●​ Return prediction results to the frontend in a structured format​
●​ Display:​
○​ Final prediction values (e.g., class label, probability, regression output)​
○​ Confidence scores if applicable​
●​ Generate simple visualizations (e.g., bar charts, probability distributions, trend graphs) to
improve interpretability​

7. Bonus Implementations

●​ Store user inputs, timestamps, and prediction outputs in a database
●​ Enable tracking of past predictions for auditing, debugging, or analytics​
●​ Ensure data privacy and secure storage practices
●​ Build low latency pipeline and reliable predictions​

Predictive Tasks
Task A — Classification
Goal:​
Distinguish CONFIRMED exoplanets from FALSE POSITIVE transit signals.
●​ Target column: koi_disposition​

Participants are expected to carefully inspect the dataset and frame the problem accordingly.

Task B — Regression

Goal:​
Predict the planetary radius (in Earth radii) for exoplanets.
●​ Target column: koi_prad

Important Notes
●​ Some features may not be available at prediction time in real observational scenarios.​
●​ Certain columns may be appropriate for one task but not the other.​
●​ Participants are expected to perform exploratory data analysis and make informed
feature-selection decisions.​
●​ Care should be taken to avoid target leakage.
●​ You can choose any tech stack you want.
●​ Suggestions for beginners - ​
You can use ​
React.js for Frontend​
Firestore firebase or PostgreSql for Databases​
Node/ Django/ Flask for backend​
​
Whichever you find easier to work with​
●​ A deployed web application would gain more points than a locally hosted application.

Evaluation
Classification
●​ Metrics: F1-score, ROC–AUC​
●​ Evaluation focuses on the binary distinction defined in Task A.​

Regression
●​ Metrics: RMSE, MAE​

●​ Evaluation is performed on physically meaningful predictions.

System Development Performance
●​ Correctness and consistency of input validation and preprocessing​
●​ Reliability and latency of real-time inference​
●​ Robust API communication and error handling​
●​ Clarity and interpretability of prediction outputs​

Data Source
The dataset is derived from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, based on the Kepler DR25
cumulative KOI catalog and corresponding stellar parameters.
Participants are encouraged to cite the NASA Exoplanet Archive in any publications or reports
resulting from this work.
