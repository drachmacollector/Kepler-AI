STELLAR ANALYTICS

INTRODUCTION
Prelude: Signals from the Stars
The Era of Discovery

The year is 2236. Humanity no longer searches the cosmos blindly.
Over the past two centuries, advances in space telescopes and observational astronomy have
transformed how we explore the universe. Missions like Kepler and its successors have
continuously monitored distant stars, detecting tiny dips in starlight—possible signs of planets
passing in front of their host stars.
These detections, known as Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs), have revolutionized exoplanet
science. However, not every signal tells the truth.
The Challenge of False Signals
Not all detected signals correspond to real planets.
Binary stars, stellar noise, instrumental errors, and background eclipsing systems often mimic
planetary transits. As a result, astronomers face a crucial challenge:
Which signals represent real exoplanets, and which are false positives?
Even after confirmation, many planetary characteristics—such as planetary radius—must be
estimated from incomplete and noisy data, relying heavily on stellar parameters and transit
behavior.
To push the boundaries of discovery, astronomers now rely on data-driven intelligence to
separate truth from illusion.

Mission Brief: The Stellar Verification Program
You are part of the Stellar Verification Program, a global initiative tasked with improving the
reliability of exoplanet discovery.
Using a merged dataset of Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) and host star parameters, your
mission is twofold:
Distinguish confirmed exoplanets from false positives
Accurately predict the planetary radius of confirmed exoplanets
Your work will help refine detection pipelines and bring us closer to understanding the
diversity of worlds beyond our solar system.

Predictive Tasks
Task A — Classification
Goal:
Distinguish CONFIRMED exoplanets from FALSE POSITIVE transit signals.
Target column: koi_disposition
Participants are expected to carefully inspect the dataset and frame the problem accordingly.
Task B — Regression

Important Notes

Some features may not be available at prediction time in real observational scenarios.
Certain columns may be appropriate for one task but not the other.
Participants are expected to perform exploratory data analysis and make informed featureselection decisions.
Care should be taken to avoid target leakage.
You can choose any tech stack you want.
Suggestions for beginners You can use
React.js for Frontend
Firestore firebase or PostgreSql for Databases
Node/ Django/ Flask for backend
Whichever you find easier to work with
A deployed web application would gain more points than a locally hosted application.
